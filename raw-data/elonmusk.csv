Jun-30-2021,20:06,@EZebroni @WholeMarsBlog You should notice several other improvements,
Jun-30-2021,20:06,"Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R 🏴‍☠️",
Jun-30-2021,20:06,"@Erdayastronaut We’ve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5.",
Jun-30-2021,19:06,"@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. We’re changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships.",
Jun-30-2021,19:06,"@Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower.",
Jun-30-2021,19:06,@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.,
Jun-29-2021,20:06,"@torybruno @Dynetics Should I bring a few spare engines … I mean, just in case.",
Jun-29-2021,20:06,@torybruno @Dynetics Sure,
Jun-29-2021,19:06,@PassionFlix @ToscaMusk I liked your movie “Hollywood Dirt”!,
Jun-29-2021,19:06,"@nextspaceflight There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp; there will be external issues too. 

That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July.",
Jun-29-2021,19:06,@torybruno @Dynetics When do the engines arrive? 😉,
Jun-29-2021,19:06,"@SpaceX Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”, which is unreasonably gigantic. 

There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken.",
Jun-29-2021,18:06,@SpaceX Sonic boom incoming https://t.co/jWAyA0j5Xx,
Jun-29-2021,18:06,"@IIHS_autosafety Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS! That’s the highest overall rating, but we think we can get max score for all subcategories/individual tests too. 

Retesting in a month or so with improved software. The improved software will then be uploaded to all cars with FSD computers.",

Jun-23-2021,23:06,"@torybruno Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate.",
