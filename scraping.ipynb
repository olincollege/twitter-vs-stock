    "## Why snscrape?\n",
    "Over the recent years, Twitter API has gotten a lot worse. Most features have been paywalled, and the ones that are available are heavily rate limited so that the servers dont get overloaded. While this is a good thing in theory for stability, it isnt ideal for people who want to actually scrape tweets from twitter and analyse data about them. Using snscrape is a good way to harvest data without using the API. The only issue is, its really poorly documented in terms of python modules and object names. This notebook explores some of the different scrapers in the library."
